Exercise 1.1

• Given the in-order traverse result and pre-order traverse result, can you reconstruct
  the tree from these result and figure out the post-order traversing
  result?

  – Pre-order result: 1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6;
  – In-order result: 4, 2, 1, 5, 3, 6;
  – Post-order result: ?

• Write a program in your favorite language to re-construct the binary tree
  from pre-order result and in-order result.

• Prove why in-order walk output the elements stored in a binary search
  tree in increase order?

• Can you analyze the performance of tree sort with big-O notation?

/*

Exercise 1.2

• Can you figure out how to iterate a tree as a generic container by using
  Pred/Succ? What’s the performance of such traversing process in terms
  of big-O?

• A reader discussed about traversing all elements inside a range [a, b].
  In C++, the algorithm looks like the below code:

    for each (m.lower bound(12), m.upper bound(26), f);

  Can you provide the purely function solution for this problem?

/*

Exercise 1.3

• There is a symmetrical solution for deleting a node which has two non-NIL
  children, to replace the element by splicing the maximum one out off the
  left sub-tree. Write a program to implement this solution.

/*

Exercise 1.4

• Write a randomly building process for binary search tree.
